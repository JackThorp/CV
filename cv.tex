\section{Work experience}

\begin{eventlist}

\item{Oct 2017 -- Feb 2019}
	{Fat Tank Studios}
	{Business Manager}

Assumed sole management of studio with no handover. Through hard work and commitment I kept the doors open (9-11, 7 days a week), turned profits and cleared a £5K inherited overdraft in just over a year before tenancy was terminated. Being proactive, confident and curious I acquired new skills from audio engineering to fitting mortice locks, repairing amps and keeping the books. Closing sales and maintaining customers necessitates attentiveness and charm. I worked with a designer to develop our Wordpress site (PHP, Gulp, Less, Jade).

\item{Aug 2016 - Feb 2019}
	{The World Transformed Festival}
	{Secretary \& Finance Coordinator}
	
Identifying and taking ownership of unpopular and difficult tasks, I instituted professional bookkeeping and transition to full time staff. My leadership and organisational abilities led to my assignment as front of house manager overseeing 25 volunteers over a four day festival with over 5,000 attendees. 

\item{Jun 2014 -- Oct 2017}
     {Fairmondo UK}
     {Founder / Director}
     
Fairmondo UK is an international project developing co-operatively owned marketplaces that make fair and sustainable consumption easy. Seeking funding and attending events I became adept at storytelling and networking. I presented to \href{https://www.uk.coop/newsroom/co-operative-amazon-wins-first-competition-tech-co-ops} {win the \#digiden prize} at the Open 2017 Conference.

\item{Apr 2015 -- Oct 2015}
     {Zuhlke Engineering}
     {Junior Developer}

Explored automating Hadoop cluster deployment using Puppet and Vagrant. Worked on a Node / MongoDB seat reservation web app. Developed Angular front end for a pervasive sensor stock tracking application. Finished with an independent project developing SPAs through composing single purpose libraries as alternative to monolithic frameworks (see MusicFam on Github).

\item{Jun 2014 -- Sep 2014}
     {Zuhlke Engineering}
     {Junior Developer}

Developed system to analyse conflict relevant data for NGO using existing data-sets, crawled websites and Twitter. Learnt and used Hadoop framework: Ambari, Zookeeper, Pig, Hive, Flume. Worked with tools such as Apache Solr for free text query, Apache Nutch for web crawling, openNLP libraries for info extraction and Apache Maven.
